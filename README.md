# Leo's TF2 Config
My TF2 config stuff. Intended for use with [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com) (Medium preset, Flat Mouse, Null-Cancelling Movement and No Tutorial) and [clovervidia's captions](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167785751).

### Sources
* Aar's [TF2 Essentials](https://aarmastah.xyz/misc/tf2e/) (blocking `unbindall` and `closed_htmlpage`, Engineer quick-build binds, a bunch of the keybinds)
* [r/tf2scripthelp](https://old.reddit.com/r/tf2scripthelp)'s ["Common Scripts" wiki page](https://old.reddit.com/r/tf2scripthelp/wiki/commonscripts)
* "Reset" keybinds are from a [JUUD0LF](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCq2Ed9Uw4notIpCzVuXPog) video, I'm pretty sure

2. Open up whatever command shell you've got.
3. `git clone https://github.com/Leo40Git/TF2Config <insert-folder-name-here>`

# Updating

2. Open up whatever command shell you've got.
3. `git pull`
